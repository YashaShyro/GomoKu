🌸 Gomoku Game — A Hololive-Inspired Journey
Welcome to my simple Gomoku game built with Java and JavaFX.
This project was created from the bottom of my heart, inspired by the warmth and joy I felt after watching Hololive.

🎮 About the Game
Gomoku (五目並べ) is a traditional Japanese board game where players take turns placing black and white stones on a 15x15 grid. The first player to align five stones in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game.

This version features:

JavaFX graphical interface with a wooden-style board 🎋

Turn-based gameplay with black and white stones ⚪⚫

Player tracking with a local SQLite database 🗃️

A heartfelt, personal touch behind every line of code 💖

✨ Inspiration
This project was born after watching Hololive, a group of incredibly talented VTubers who brought me so much comfort and inspiration during my journey. Their strength, passion, and laughter reminded me how beautiful it is to live in this era.

Creating this game also reflects my quiet dream:

✨ To someday study in Japan and live a life surrounded by the culture I love. 🇯🇵

🧠 Technologies Used
Java 17

JavaFX

SQLite (via JDBC)

MVC structure (Model-View-Controller)

💌 A Note from the Developer
Hi! I’m the developer of this project—just a student with big dreams and a love for Japan, game development, and Hololive.
Working on this was not just about learning code, but expressing part of my heart. I hope anyone who sees this feels a little warmth from it.

Made with love and dreams,
